# Smartcab

**This Project Has Been Confirmed As Successful By A Udacity Reviewer.**

Designed an AI driving agent for the smartcab. It should receive inputs at each time step t, and generate an output move. Based on the rewards and penalties it gets, the agent should learn an optimal policy for driving on city roads, obeying traffic rules correctly, and trying to reach the destination within a goal time. Project 4 of the Udacity Machine Learning Nanodegree program - details included.
